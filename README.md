## Overview
Financial illiteracy is a real problem in the modern-day world. Meanwhile, investing is probably one of the most important ways to ensure financial safety. However, many people are not familiar of the stock market and arenâ€™t willing to risk investing. Our project aims to help users gain a better understanding of the stock market overall, and helps the user make better decisions on investments. We chose to use the data of the S&P 500, a portfolio of stocks of the 500 largest corporations by market capitalization in the US market. We collected the historical data of these stocks and visualized them in several ways to help users understand these abstract data.

## Functionalities
1. Overview of the S&P500 index, using line graph to show trend.
2. Treemap of the stock market from 2016 to 2020. Users can select date of interest from dropdown bar, or utilize the drag bar to explore changes.
3. Changes in prices for each stock of the S&P500 portfolio, using line graph to show trend. Users can input the specific tickers of their interest to explore specific stocks, and they can select date range of interest using dropdown menu.
4. Customizable portfolio simulator. Users can input tickers and the amount they bought/would like to buy, the doughnut chart will show the components and weights of each stock; bubble chart underneath provides an interesting way as well to show the weight, price change, and sectors of each of the stock input by the user.

## Work Breakdown
Hanna implemented the treemap and the customizable line graph that shows closing prices trends.

Helen implemented the portfolio simulator.

Boyang helped in implementing treemap by adding labels, produced a homepage that integrated all parts together, as well as correcting styles.

We split the writings.

The process of development was spread out over time, but it was a bit of a rush in the last few days.
